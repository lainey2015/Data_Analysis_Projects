# (Fordgobike trip Data Exploration)


## Dataset

> This data consists of records regarding 183412 entries of share-bike trips including user and bike information, the lasting time and locations of the trips, and whether the users chose share-bikes for all trips.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that the main users came from those born between 1980 and 2001. After applying log transformation, the distribution of duration_sec followed normal distribution and results showed that the majority of users used bike between 100 to 3000 seconds. By using bar plotting, I found that Market St at 10th St was the most popular trip starting site. Following that, bar plotting showed that users who were born in 2001 had the longest trip duration time.

Then, I found customers preferred to used share bike for long time trips compared with the subscribers after plotting their average trip duration time. Meanwhile, the average trip duration time correlates with the member genders. Moreover, a small portion of users chose share bike for all trips, especially those were customers. Heatmap plotting showed that trips started at start_station_latitude between 37.7 and 37.8 and start_station_longitude around -122.4 lasted longer, and people prefer to use share-bikes for all trips tend to be younger and they were in favour of short riding time compared to those who sometimes choose share-bike trips.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the factors that have influence on the duration time of the bike trips. I start by plotting the distribution of frequency of using share bikes over uses' birth year, followed by the analysis on the pattern of the duration time of trips with a transformed histogram plot. Bar plot showed the top ten popular start position for trips.

Afterwards, the trend of the average trip duration time over the users' birth year, user types and member genders were plotted, followed by the preference of choosing share bikes for all trips wether it depends on user types and member genders were analysed. Additionally, the popularity of the start position of trips were plotted by using heatmaps

In the end, the relationship among the duration time of trips, member birth year and whether users chose share bikes for all trips were analysed and plotted by heatmaps.
